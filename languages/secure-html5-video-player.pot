"Secure HTML5 Video Player is a video plugin for WordPress built on the "
"VideoJS HTML5 video player library. It allows you to embed video in your "
"post or page using HTML5 with Flash fallback support for non-HTML5 "
"browsers.  The settings can be easily configured with this control panel and "
"with simplified short codes inserted into posts or pages.  Video files can "
"be served privately; pseudo-streamed from a secured directory."
