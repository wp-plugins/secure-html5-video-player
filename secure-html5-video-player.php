	Selects a media server from the list of available media servers using the client

	of server load, available bandwidth, and physical proximity to the client.
	returns the address the of the plugin directory on the remote server.

	$client_ip and $video_filename

	If the function was named my_function, then it would be registered by calling the following
	in your Wordpress template's functions.php:
	
		add_filter('secure_html5_video_player_get_media_server_address', 'my_function', 10, 2);
